12 INTRODUCTION.

after this has been done, there still remains a great difference
between Plautus' iambics and those of Catullus or Horace or,
at a later age, Seneca3 and this is, of course, only to be ex-
pected, for Plautus was a pioneer in verse writing, and wrote
before the language had received a literary form; so that it
would be as unjust to expect perfect literary polish and exact-
ness in his verses as to try the lines of Middleton by the
standard of Tennyson. Plautus was one of the first to set
himself to translate Greek plays into Latin, using the same
metre as he found in the Greek originals; and his attempts
were often no more successful than Ennius' reproduction of
Homer’s hexameters‚ or Cicero’s rendering of Sophocles, e.g.

Trach. 1100—
τόν τε χρυσέων

δράκοντα μήλων φύλακ’ ἐπ’ ἐσχάτοις τόποις,
dracon Ι em aurife Ι ram obtfi Ι tu adser Ι vantem έι· Ι horem,
or, we may even say, than some pentameters of Catullus himself:
e. g. 73. 6—
quam modo qui me unum atque unicum amicum habuit (l).
One great reason why Plautus’ lines are hard to scan is that
he lived earlier than Ennius, who introduced most of the
metrica] laws by which classical Latin poetry is bound, and
who gave the Latin language a distinct literary shape. Ennius,
for instance, made it a usage of Latin poetry that a short vowel
might be treated as long before two consonants‚ such as crin
the middle of a word. This usage was unknown to Plautus,
and so in his lines such a word as sacrum is never scanned
sacrum. Again, in Ennius’ time the consonants‚ m, s, t, n, d
and others, were often hardly sounded at the end of a word.
The three last words, for example, of Catullus' line quoted
above would be pronounced (both in Ennius’ time and later)
unz'cu' amz'czc’ habuit, the only trace of the m being in the
nasal pronunciation of the u: somnus reliquit would be pro-
nounced somnu’ reliquit <as we could imagine it pronounced
in modern French); amaris before a word beginning with a
consonant would sound like amari' or amare3 dedit in the
