1. PLO'I' OF THE ‘CAP'I'IVL'

THE ‘Captivi’ is unlike most other Plautine Comedies in its
serious tone. Its subject is the faithful attachment of a slave
to his master, without any of the love intrigues of young spend-

with the view of exchanging him for his son. Tyndarus and
Philocrates, however, have made a plot to interchange names
and dress, so that Hegio unwittingly sends Philocrates away
to Elis to arrange the ransom, thinking him to be the slave and
not the master, while he retains Tyndarus, the slave. The trick
