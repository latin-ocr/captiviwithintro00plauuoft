1·2·77—11-1·1-9· NOTES. LJNES 174-203·

185. commetat: hequentative of commeo. ‘ My table keeps the
stony path?

188. essitas: frequentative of edo.

189. ‘ 'Tis of the earth, earthy: Your pig is a beast of the earth [so
pork will be included in your bill of fare].——I mean, mostly vegetables.
—Open a hospital then.' Hegio's dinner was to be like Horaee's, Epp.
1. init.:

5 Si potes Archiacis conviva recumbere lectis,

Nec modica cenare times olus omne patella.

191. Numquid uis Ρ the regular formula of leave-taking. ‘ Is that
all then ? '

193. siet=sz·t. This is really an optative form like εἴην, which was
originally * ἐσίην, as siem was originally * esz'em. The ie is contracted to ἰ
(cf. v. 247) in sim, and in the other subjunctives in -im, e. g. duim (v. 947),
velim, edim, etc.; ‘ to see the state of my little account at the banker's.’

194. ire dixeram sor me iturum esse dixeram. This construction
is common in the Comedians, and is used side by side with the regular
one in Most. 621 dic te daturum ut abeat. TH. egon dicam dare? The
difference between the two is like the difference between the syntax of ‘ Ι
said I would go ' and ‘1 spoke of going ' in English. And we say, ‘ I
hope to go ' as well as ‘ Ι hope I shall go?

dixeram for dixi. Cf. v. 17.
iuero for ibo. The use of the fut. pf. for the fut. is a feature of
colloquial Latin. Cf. Mil. 3. 2. 50 reuenero ; Trin. 3. 1. 24 abscessero, etc.

Aer II. SCENE Ι.

The captives, being left with the overseers on the stage, get permission
to have a private talk. They discuss their plot to personate each other,
so that Philocrates may get his liberty and Tyndarus be left as a hostage.
This scene is a canticum, i.e. a song, or musical recitative, as opposed to
a diverbium, i. e. a dialogue unaccompanied by music. (See Intro-
duction, p. 21.)

195. si: ‘ since,’ not ‘ if.’ So often si quidem.

199. The reading duramque erili imperio has been suggested : ‘ a
master's order makes it hard to bear, but you can sosten it by the temper
you bear it with!

201. What the true reading is that lies hidden in the multa mz‘raclz'tz‘s
of the MSS. is hard to say. Perhaps multam iram editis.

203. pudet. . . . pigeat alludes to the saying nimio z'd quod pudet
facilius firtur quam illud quodngret Pseud. 281 (cp. Trin. 345).

quia. Cf. v. 153.
