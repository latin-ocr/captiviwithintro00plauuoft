v. 1. 9—2· 2. NOTES. LJNES 900-955·

930. Hoc agamus ε ‘ and now to the main point.’ Hoc age is a common
phrase in every-day Latin (cf. v. 444) for calling on a person to devote
himself to some matter that required to be done. Philocrates has
shown symptoms of impatience during Hegio’s enumeration of his bles-
sings, and Philopolemus, who divines his new friend's anxiety for the
instant release of his faithful slave, courteously interferes on his behalf. ·

935. bene merenti. Benevolens is always used as a substantive
by Plautus, ‘a well wisber,’ but bene merens never; so translate, ‘ our
friend who well deserves it]

muneres =munereris. A good many deponents occur in an active
form in old Latin and vice versa, e. g. insectabit v. 593 ; minitas v. 743 ;
exauspicauiv. 766 ; arbz'trarem Pseud. 4. 2. 57; contempla Mil. 4. 2.
39, etc. The word always means ‘to present,’ not ‘to recompense‚' in
Plautus.

938. reliqueram. Cf. v. 194.

944. conpeditum z ‘ fettered ; ‘ an ante-classica] verb.

945. reseiui : from rescisco, ‘to find out,’ ⁶ learn :’ ante-classical.

946. euenisse: inf. of exclamation. This construction is found in
the earliest Latin writers, and so should not be explained by the ellipse
of flagitium est or anything of the kind. It is a verbal noun in the
acc. case, just as an ordinary noun is put in the acc. in exclamations. In
this passage of Cicero, for example, the construction oflzominem cannot be
distinguished from that of discribere, Cic. Verr. 5. 25 huncine hominem!
hancine impudentiam, iudices ,Ι lianc audaciam Ι civitatibus pro numero
militum pecuniarum summas discribere! certum pretium . . . consti-
tuere !

meum eaput=me, as in vae capiti tuo, etc.

947. libellam : a small silver coin, 3¹15 of a denarius. Hence = a trifle,

‘ a farthing.’

duis: a subjunctive of the same formation as velim, nolim, malim,
sim, edim, from duo, an old form of do, surviving in interduo v. 694
supr.

949. Facis benigne= ‘ thank you Ι ’ Cf. v. 843.

951. interibi=interim in old Latin.

statua. uerberea: ‘whipping post.’ Stalagmus is standing as
dumb as a statue, or, as we might say, as a post. Verberea=‘com-
posed of verbera?

952. quid sit factmn filio: the abl. in this construction is really an
abl. of the instrument, lit. ‘ what has been done with my son as an in-
strument.’

955. We may picture Stalagmus to ourselves as a scowling fellow of
few words, with a stem realization of the inevitable. Perhaps his name
