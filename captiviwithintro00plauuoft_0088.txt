PLAVTI CAPTIVI.

lar nomen nequid debeam. In early Latin the word reliquus was of four
syllables.
alieno uti nil moror: ‘none of the credit system for me.’

17. dixeram=dixi or dicebam. We often find the pluperfect in the
comedians where we· should expect the perfect: cf. infr. 194 dixeram3
305 fueram ; 938 reliqueram. In Most. 3. Ι. 134 Simo says of his
house eo pretio empti fuerant olim, ‘ I gave a long price for it when I
bought it) using empti fucrant where in strict language empti sunt
should have been said. Tranio pretends to understand him to imply
that the house is no longer his. In Cicero we hardly find traces of this
loose use of the pluperfect, but it is very common in Sallust and Tacitus,
especially the former: e. g. Cat. 18 transtulerant ; 24 concusserat;
Jug. 57 muniverat ; 64 accenderat.

18. dominum: ‘ his young master.'

2ο. quasi : ‘ about,' =fere, a common use of the word in Plautus, e. g.
Most. 3. 1. 91 debet quasi quadraginta minas.

22. ‘ Aye 1 the gods make shuttlecocks of us? Cf. the Greek proverb,
θεῶν παίγνια ἅνθρωποι.

Δ 24. Postquam belligerant. The historical present after postquam
quum, etc. is more frequent in the conversational style of the comedians
than in prose-writers. We have postquam video infr. v. 4873 postquam
occasiost Mil. 1 24 ; postquam abs te abit ib. 1 3 30.

2 5. fit. In early Latin poetry the long vowel offi‘o is preserved in
the third sing. fit. In the classical period fit was pronounced short, like
other third singulars in -t.

27. hic: i. e. Hegio.

oonmeroari z ‘ buy up.'

28. qui: the locative, here used for the abl. quo, ‘ hoping to find one
to exchange for his son—-his prisoner son, I mean, sor he knows nothing
of this son (pointing to T yndarus) he has at home.’

30. indaudiuit. This old Latin preposition indu, endo (a form of in}
appears also in z‘ndzpz'scon indugredi, induperator3 Lucr. 4. 967 indu-
peratores pugnare et proelia obire.

loeo ε ‘ rank.'

32. ‘ To save his son he would not save his money.¹

33. Reconciliare: ‘to get back.' Concilio, lit. ‘to call together,'
from cum and alcal„ as in calata comitia, clamo, καλέω, (cf. concilium),
has in old Latin the sense of ‘to procure‚’ especially ‘to procure by
purchase,‘ and is a common word sor buying in Plautus.

34. quaestoribus : the quaestores urbani were the officials who
received the booty taken in war, and sold it by public auction (sub hasta).

35. Hisce=lzz‘. In old Latin we osten find -o stems forming their
