PLA UTINE PROSOD Υ. 1 3

same situation would sound (as we find it spelt on old inscrip—
tions) dede3 even the final -nt of dederunt was lazily dropped
in pronunciation‚ and the word made to sound dedere. Plautus
allows all these pronunciations in his verses——

Capt. Ι. 1. 6 estne invocatu' an non est? est planissume.

υ υ - Ι

,, 1. 2. 11 sumu' quarn servimus.
υ ν -l

„ Ι. 2. 15 ita u' dicis.

Ennius, however, established it as a usage for all subsequent
poetry‚ that certain of them should be allowed and others not
allowed. He allowed, or rather enforced, the dropping of final
m when the next word began with a vowel or h3 amicum
habuit, for example, was necessarily pronounced amicu' habuit,
so that the last syllable of amicum ending in the vowel u (now
that the m was dropped) was elided before the initial syllable
of habuit. But in a case like amicum perdidit, where the word
following the final m began with a consonant, the m was not
allowed to be dropped. The words could not scan amz'czi' per-
didit, but only amicum perdidit. He also allowed, but did not
enforce, the elision of final s before an initial consonant, a
practice which was, however, dropped by 'the Augustan poets‚
although it left its traces even in prose literature in the double
forms of the 2nd sing. pass. amaris and amare, etc. But he
did not allow final t, n, dor any other consonant to be dropped,
although the form of the 3rd plur. perf. ind. in -re for -runt
forced its way both into poetry and prose.

Plautus’ verses, then, belong to a time when the metrical
laws, to which all later Latin poetry conformed, had not yet
been fixed. They reproduce the ordinary pronunciation of
everyday life, much more than the artificial language of later
Latin poetry¹‚ and that is what Cicero meant when he said

² We might find a parallel in the artificial pronunciation of the word
‘wind' as ‘ wind' in English poetry‚
