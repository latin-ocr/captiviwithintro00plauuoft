PLA VTJ CAPTIVJ. IV. 2. 60-86.

every-day Latin. Cf. Catullus. 2.2 et quantum est hominum venustiorum.
The Latin language has a liking for the partitive genitive3 cf. quid negotii
est ?, adbuc locorum, etc.

840. anteum-tunt : ‘ take the precedence of.'

843. Bene facis=‘ thank you!' Bemgrne facis is another common
phrase of the kind.

844. uoltum, i. e. ‘you greedy sellow.' We should probably say, ‘you
greedy wolf !' This -ί of the voc. is really a contraction of -z'e‚ and so
uolturi = volturio, mi ’- mie = mee.

846. astitui=‘ to be set near ’ (the fire).

848. praestinatum. Both praeslino and destino are common words
for ‘ buying ’ in Plautus, e.g. Most. 3. 1. 113 eas quanti destinat? They
are compounds of ²¹< stano, a nasalized present tense of sto, just as danunt
(v. 819) is a nasalized present form from do. Pracstino means literally
‘to settle, bargain for, besorehand.'

850. bene esse: ‘to enjoy yourself.' Cf. Men. 484 minore num-
quam bene fui dispendio.

si sit unde ε ‘ if you have the means.'

852. Nominandi istorum. This construction stands midway between

. the old construction nominandi ista (e. g. Trin. 869 hercle opinor mi

aduenienti lzac noctu agitandumst mgr'lz'as ; Lucr. Ι. 1 1 1 aeternas quoni-
am poenas in morte limcndumst), and the classical construction nomi-
nandorum istorum. Other examples of it are Cic. Phil. 5. 3. 6 agitur
utrum M. A ntonz'o facultas detur . . . agrorum suis latronibus condonandi ,·
Lucr. 5. 1 22 3 poenarum grave sit solvendi tempus adultum ; Ter. Heaut.
29 novarum qui spectandi faciunt copiam. It is only found with the
gen. of the gerund, and perhaps only with a plural noun.

854. frustra esse: ‘ to be mistaken3' a common phrase in colloquial
Latin.

S 5 5. uioti=victus. Many words which in the classical period were
‹leclined according to the fourth declension only were in early Latin de-
clined also according to the second, e. g. senati, quaesti, tumulti, etc.
The double declension has forced itself into the classical language in
the ease of domus, which is always 2nd decl. in Plautus.

856. uotem. Cf. v. 703.

857. Tu ne: the regular idiom in colloquial Latin. Cf. Trin. 634
LY. egone :⁹ LE. tu ne ; Most. 4. 2. 39, etc. The ne is the particle ‘in-
deed,’ ‘ verily,’ sometimes (but wrongly) written nae.

862. Qum-:cun just as quum (quom) =cum, sequutus =secutus, etc.

863. Quoi deum=cui deorum.

866. Mihi quidem essurio, non tibi. Ergasilus pretends to have un-
derstood Hegio to say videre—esurire milei and not videre milei—esurire.
