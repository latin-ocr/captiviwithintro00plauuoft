22 INTRODUCTION.

sidered so important a part of the play that the name of the
performer at the first celebration of a play was always stated
aster the title in Roman editions of Plautus and Terence; and
many such names have been preserved sor us in MSS. of these
authors. The title-page, for example, of a Roman copy of the
Plzormio of Terence would read 2—Acla ludis Romanis L. Pos-
tumio Albino L. Cornelio Merula aedilibus curulibus. Egit
L. Ambz'vizcs Turpio [the aclorprimarum] M odos fecit Flaccus
Claudi [sc. libertus] tibiis imparibus, etc. ; and this title—page,
or didascalia, as it is called, has been preserved in the Bembine
MS. of Terence. The musical parts of a play are easily known
from their not being in iambic trimeters. This was the metre
of dialogue passages-(diverbia), while all variations from it
come under the head of cantica. But we must distinguish
between those cantica which were sung to music (mutatis modis
cantica, in lyric metreS, such as Capt. 195 sqq, 497 sqq.)‚ and
the much more frequent class, where the music played a sub—
ordinate part, which were rather recited or intoned than sung,
viz. passages in trochaic tetrameters, iambic tetrameters, &c.,
e.g. Capt. 240 sqq. and passim. From a passage in Livy (7. 2),
there would seem to have been a custom on the Roman stage
for aetors to have remained silent during cantica (probably the
lyric cantica only), and to have occupied themselves with the
suitable gesticulation alone, the actual words being left to a
singer stationed, we may suppose, behind the scenes. But how
sar this custom prevailed we do not know. It was the singer
(cantor) who came forward at the fall (or rather rise¹) of the
curtain, and asked the applause of the spectators in the words
plausum dale or plaudite, although sometimes the whole troupe
of actors appeared on the stage at the close of the performance
and delivered a regular Epilogue (as in the Captivi).

¹ The curtain was lowered at the commencement‚ and raised at the
end osa Roman play.
