PLAUTJNE PROSODY. 11

iambic line, but becomes quite rhythmical when we substitute
for ‘obiurgare’ the old form which we find in the Ambrosian
palimpsest (Trin. 70) ‘obiurigare ’—

obiu 1 riga Ι re pater Ι haec noc Ι tes et Ι dies.
In the same way, by restoring the old form of the acc. me, le,
which, we know from inscriptions, ended in -d in the time of
Plautus, to such lines as—

Mil. Glor. 1382 te volt, te quaerit, ted expectat, deperit,
we remove the hiatus, just as the insertion of the digamma into
a line of Homer like

Od. 1. 4 πολλὰ δ’ ὅ γ’ ἐν πόντῳ πάθεν ἄλγεα ([ἷ)ὂν κατὰ θυμόν,
removes the hiatus betwen ἄλγεα and ὅν.

In these two cases that we have mentioned, ‘obiurigare' and
acc. ‘ted,’ the old form differs in spelling from the classica]
form. In a good many cases, however, the spelling was the
same, but the pronunciation was different. A comparative,
like stultior, was spelt in the same way in Plautus⁷ time as at a
later time (although at a period before Plautus it had been spelt
stultz‘os); but while Virgil and his contemporaries pronounced
the word stultzffr, Plautus and his contemporaries pronounced
it stultz'ffr. So that a line like Bacch. 1. 2. 15—

Ι stultior es barbaro poticio,

is only irregular when we read the words as a later age would
have pronounced them, just as the third line of the ‘ Canterbury
Tales’ would be if we read it according to nineteenth-century
pronunciation—

‘And bathed every vein in such liquor ;'
or as the rhyme in Pope’s lines would be,—

‘And thou, great Anna, whom three realrns obe>-

Dost sometimes counsel take and sometimes teas
if we did not pronounce the word tea, as it was pronounced in
Pope’s time, tay.

A great many of the irregularities in the lines of Plautus
disappear when we restore the old forms of the words. But even
