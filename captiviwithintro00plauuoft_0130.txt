CAPTIVI: NOTES ΟΝ READINGS.

probably interdico aiant. Fleckeisen's interduo is a questionable use
of the word.

v. 791. emz'nor interminorque B. Brix removes que. Fleck. reads
minor and ekes out the mette by adding lzodz'e after mi. Schoell obstet
obuiam.

v. 832. pultando vel assultatz'm B. Assultatim, an adverbial form
from assulto, the frequentative of assilio, would mean ‘by leaping
upon.‘ In the MS. from which B was copied we may suppose the
scribe had written this word above the obscure word assulatim as
a various reading, vel assullatz'm ⁴ or, as some read, assultatz'm.' The
writer of B copied vel assultatim as part of the line.

v. 850. pernamssatque opthalmiam of the MSS. leaves an awkward
hiatus. Besides, the mention of ham in a list of fishes seems rather odd.
Fleek. suggests muraenam, ‘a lamprey;' Brix peream, ‘a perch3’
Schoell sepiolam‚ ‘ a euttle-fish.’

v. 862. atque agnum adferri proprium pinguem MSS„ propere unum
Brix ς propere Fleek. with lzuc after agnum3 propritim Bentley3 prop-
teruom Schoell.

v. 882. See the note. Schoell reads iam, dz'uz'.

v. 896. The MSS. have mantiscinatus, which Schoell retains, ex-
plaining it as manu tesca faciens, ‘ laying waste.’
