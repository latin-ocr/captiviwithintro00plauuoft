111. 5, 46-67. NOTES. LJNES 670—725.

704. Quor. See v. 862.

705. ‘ Because the truth would have hurt the person Ι wished to serve.’

706. optumest and bene est are stock expressions: ‘ all is well;
Ι desire nothing more.’

708. custodem addiderat: addo is the verb regularly used in this
phrase in Latin. Cf. Virg. A. 6. 90 nec Teucris addita Iuno Ι usquam
aberit. ‘ Made me his attendant!

710. sorsum=se (equivalent of sine) 4- uersum or uersum, ‘to the
away turning‚’ ‘in the contrary direction: ‘ otherwise.’ The compound
of sub and versum is sursum. Cf. v. 656.

712. faxet ε faxit is probably the true reading.

713. Emitteresne . . . manu: ‘ would you manumit? ' Emz'ttere manu
is the regular phrase in the Comedians.

714. Essetne=nonne esset? -Nonne is seldom found in Plautus.—
The true relation of the three particles -ne, nonne, num, to each other is
this: -ne is the particle of interrogation. In questions that expected a
positive answer non was generally inserted, just as we insert ‘ not ' in
English, ‘is not this the case?' hocne non ita se habet? or nonne lzoc
ita se habet? and in course of time the use of non with ne became the
stereotyped form for such questions. qum is simply the adverb of time
‘now,‘ which in classical Latin only appears in the form strengthened
by the particle -ce‚ viz. nunc ιζ = numce), but which is seen in a shorter form
in such phrases as nudius tertius, etc. :num dics tertius, ‘ it is now the
third day since? It stands to nunc in the same relation as the Greek
enclitic νυν to the adverb νῦν. In questions that expected a negative
answer num or nunc was generally inserted, just as we insert ‘ now' in
English, ‘ now is this the case? ' num lzoc ita se habet? and so its use in
such questions became the rule in classical Latin.

7 1 7. postulauisti = ἠξίωσας.

718. nuperum. Nuperus is an ante-classieal word, but it survives in
the adverb nuper=nuper-um (ef. nihil: nihilum), being, of course, de
rived from novus, like mintius: *noventz'us, sszz'ter=³²}s0v-pater, ete.

nouieium= ‘ a newly purchased slave ;’ the regular word.

719. 'I'e perdocere: perdocere. Cf. v. 7 39.

723. latomias lapidarias. The Greek and Latin words stand curi-
ously side by side here. In fact the whole of Roman comedy has a
hybrid appearance, half Greek and half Latin. The plays are translations
from the Greek, and the scene is laid in Greece ; the actors wore the
Greek pallium, not the Roman toga5 and Greek words occur in every
dozen lines.

725. Cotidiano=qu0tidie, very rare.

sesquiopus t ‘half as much work again.'
