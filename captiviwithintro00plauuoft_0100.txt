PLA VTI CAPTIVI. Π· 2· 10·²3·

260. fuat. The line is a trochaie septenarius and scans:
Mffquff t51 nabis Ι si lzz'nc ἅὸέΙ ᾱνηᾶς 1 sz‘fii 1 ᾱί ᾶί 1 [α’-εἴ, ὃ.
The third sing. subj. in Latin had originally the vowel in the final
syllable long as in Greek, fuat, φύῃζτ), but this final syllable came to be
shortened‚ like so many other final syllables in Latin, owing to the
tendency of the Latin language to throw back the accent from the end
of the word. Cf. pdtb‘r and πατήρ.

261. 1111. The locative case of ille (stem illo-). The particle -ce
(like -γε 111 ἔγωγε) was often attached to pronouns in Latin. In the
earlier language it might be attached or not attached at pleasure, illi
and illice or illic ,· illim and z‘llimce or illinc ,¹ illud and illudce or illuc:
but in course of time the usage came to be stereotyped that certain forms
should have the particle aud certain should not. Thus illi was limited
to the dative, illic to the adverb (i.e. locative); haec to the nom. sing.
fem„ hae to the nom. plur. fem.‚ etc.‚ etc.

Caesari, etc. ‘ VVhatever 1 do not know, I shall give you sor unknown?

266. The helplessness osa man in the barber’s hands, or of a sheep
while being shorn, made tondeo a common expression for ‘to cheat ’ in
Latin. Cf. our ‘to fleece.’

‘ Now the old sellow is in the barber's hands 3 see! the scissors are
at his head; vnot a serap of a towel on his shoulders to protect his coat!
will it be a close crop, I wonder, or just a little off? Sure, if he knows
his duty, he ’11 dock him wells
