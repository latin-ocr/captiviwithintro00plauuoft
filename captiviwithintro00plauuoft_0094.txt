faxis: saxo, faxim, amasso, amassim, ausim, etc. seem to be
formed with eso or ero, the future of sum (originally esum), just like
secero, fecerim, amavero, amaverim, etc. It is a law os the Latin lan-
guage that s between two vowels becomes r, e. g. onustus but oneratus,
arbustum but arboretam, Etrusci but Etruria, so that feceso, fecesim,
etc. would come to be pronounced by a Roman fecero, fecerim. In the
sormsfax0,faxim‚ ete. the e had been dropped, just as it was dropped
in the forms dextra, infra, etc. but retained in the forms dextera, inferi,
cte, and the s coming between a consonant and a vowel (c and ο), and
not between two vowels (e and o), would be retained in Roman pronun-
ciation. Amasso is ama(v)so‚ just as armiro is αηιαζῡῖενο, amassim
is ama(v)sim, just as amcirim is ama(v)ert'm ; ausim should be (tussim,
just as causa should be, or rather was in the Classical period, caussa, ete.
