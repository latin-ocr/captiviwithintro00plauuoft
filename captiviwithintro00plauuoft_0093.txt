Aer I. SCENE 2.

Hegio comes on the stage with the two captives, attended by lorariz'.
He gives Ergasilus an invitation to dinner, which the latter accepts con-
ditionally in default of a better.

110. The lorarius was the overseer of the slaves, so called from the
whip of thongs (lora, n. pl.) with which he punished them, the
‘flogger.' The word was obsolete after Plautus‘ time. Cf. Aul. Gell.
10. 3. 19 tanquam in scenicis fabulis qui dicebantur ‘ lorarz'z' ’ quos erant
iussi vinciebant aut verberabant.

sis, from sz·v2·s‚ ‘ if you wish‚’ ‘if you please‚' the v being dropped, as
in audii for audivi, redii for redivi, eto, and the z'z' being contracted to
z‘, as in gratis for gratiis. The plural is sultis, i.e. sz' vullis, e. g. infr. v.
456 seruate istum sultis intus, serui.

γ istos captiuos duos: by inverse attraction. Cf. v. 1.

112. catenas singularias: ‘the light irons.’ Both this and catenae
maiores seem to be technieal terms for different sorts of setters used for
slaves and criminals.

115. uti adsementur‚ with ellipse of date operam, or videle; ‘see
that they are kept.' Cf. ὅπως in Greek in such sentences as νῦν οὖν ὅπως
σώσειε μ’ ἐπεὶ κάπώλεσας Ar. Nub. 1 177. With ellipse of cupio, ut with
the subj. is a common formula sor wishes in old Latin, e. g. Ter. Eun. 2.
3. 11 ut illum di deaeque senium perdant. ln Classical Latin utinam
(i. e. uti or ut with the particle nam as in quisnam, etc.) became the
established expression in such caseS, although ut is used by the poets now
and then; e. g. Ov. Her. 13. 161 quod ut videam canis albere capillis.

uti (always i in Plautus) is the old form of ul, still seen in utinam.

116. Similis, dissimilis, consimilis, etc. take the gen. in Plautus.
Even in classical Latin the gen. seems to be the favourite construction
with similis, proprius, etc., with which the English idiom requires the
dat.5 ‘like to a person‚’ ‘proper to a person,’ etc.

Tr. : ‘ A prisoner with the prison door open is a regular wild-bird.’

119. 1ubentius=libmtius. See v. 2 9²·

120. Non uidere ita. tu quidem: ‘you do not look like it,’ i. e. like
preferring to be free than to be a slave, Hegio means that, if the
lorarz'us did prefer freedom, he would save up his peculium and purchase
his freedom. The lorarz'us says he has not money to purchase his
freedom‚ and jocularly asks Hegio (with a play on the word dare) if
he would advise him to run away. Hegio replies that he will be
punished if he tries it. ‘Ayex we ’d all sar rather be free than slaves.—
Faith! you do not look like it.—-Sha11 I pay my adieux‚ then, if Ι
can’t my ransom? —I’ll pay you out, if you d0.'
