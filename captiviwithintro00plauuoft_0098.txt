215. istim was the old adverb for ‘from the place where you are.'
In the classieal period its compound with the enclitic palticle -ce was
used, istinc (=ist2'm 4- ce, like hujusce, haec=lme ÷ ce, etc.). The
similar formation illim, e.g. Most. 2. 2. 26, was discarded sor illinc,
although olim (derived from olle, the old form of ille) was retained, in
the sense, however, not of ‘ from that place,’ but of ‘ in that time‚' ‘ then,’
‘ formerly.’ Hinc points to an obsolete *him ; deinde (i. e. dc 4- im -ιν de),
exinde, inde (i. e. im ÷de)‚ dein, deinde, exin, or exim, exinde, proin,
proinde, ete. to another such formation from the pronoun is. We have
