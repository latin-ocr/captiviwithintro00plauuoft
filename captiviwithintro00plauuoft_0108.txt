PLA VTI CAPTIVI. 111. 1. 12-26.

imi supselli: ‘ at the far end of the table.’ Another reading
is uni (=unz'us)‚ but it is difficult to see what this would mean. It is
explained that parasites and inferiors were not allowed to sit on the
gnests' couches (lecti) at dinner, but only on benches (subsellia) placed
beside the conches. If this be referred to in uni, we might translate it
⁴ who get nothing but the benches.'

472. ‘Those Sir Knock-me-downs‚ with nothing but their talk to
live by.’ He talks of the diuers-out as if they belonged to a noble
family, the Plagrpatz'dae (like the Collz'crepz'dae, ‘ collar rattlers' of Trin.
4. 3. 14).

473. reddant, i. e. ⁴ return the invitation?

474. opsono = ὀψωνῶ, is a common word in the Comedians for ‘ buying
victuals,’ ‘ catering,' ‘ marketing.’

prouincia: in Plautus' time meant simply any charge or duty
entrusted to a magistrate. Cf. Mil. 1159. The derivation of the word
is uncertain.

476. in tribu: i.e. at the Comitia T rc'buta in its legal capacity as a
court.

477. terunei: ‘ a farthing.’ The teruncius was ἑ as, 3 unciae.
¹ 478. dudum ε ‘ a short time ago‘ (common in the Comedians and

Cicero), viz. aster the conversation with Hegio at the end of Act 1.

479. atque ε ‘ and all at once ; ’ a common expression in every-day
Latin. ‘ At the word they 're dumb.’ Cf. Most. 1050 quom eum conuo-
cauz', atque illi me ex senatu segregant.

480. h00=lzuc. Hoc was the original form both of the sing. neut.
and of the adverb ‘ hither ’ (which was nothing but the acc. sing. neut.).
In the classieal period it became the usage to confine hoc to the prononn,
lzztc to the adverb. Still Virg. A. 8. 423 has hoc tunc ignipotens caelo
descendit ab alto. ‘ Who says “to my house ‘?’' Who makes an offer?

481. me rident: ¹ laugh at my joke.'

abnuont : ‘ they shake their heads.' A bnuo is the regular word in
Latin to indicate refusal; caput quatio or quasso indicates sorrow or
anger, e.g. iamque caput quassans grandis suspirat arator, Lucr. 2. 1 164.

482. unum. The numeral takes the place of the indefinite article in
colloquial Latin, but never quite got this footing in the classical language,
although in the Romance languages of course it is the regular indefinite,
as ille or hic became the regular definite article.

483. menstrualis epulas: ‘ free board sor a month.'

apiscier :apiscz', in classical Latin adipt‘scz'.

484. de conpe0t0=de compacto, but the right spelling is compeclus
from compeciscor, and compaclus from compingo.

486. dentis ut restringerent: ‘ by showing their teeth.' Cf. stm'ngere
