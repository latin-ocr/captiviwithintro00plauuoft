the prohibition is addressed to a definite person. In such a case the per-
fect subj. is used, ‘ ne dederis,’ or ‘noli ' with the pres. inf.

332. amittam. Cf. v. 36.

333. oras, ‘ Say‚’ the old sense os the word, for oro is derived from
os, ‘ the mouth? Cs. Virg. A. 10. 96 talibus orabat Iuno. Orator in
old Latin ‘ an ambassador,’ ‘ spokesman,' e. g. Liv. 1. 15, etc.

334. seruitutem seruit : a favourite construction with Plautus.
Cf. messem metere Trin. 1. 1. 113 sermones serere Mil. 3. 1. 1055 sta-
tuam statuere Bacch. 4. 3. 1, etc. ; cf. infr. 358 benefit beneficium.

335. In the excitement of the discovery Tyndarus rather forgets the
part heis acting and breaks out into slave-slang. [Aside] ‘ The de-
pendant of my master here. [To Hegyo] Why! the thing's easy, as
ready to hand as rain when it pours.’ A servant in an English comedy
would probably say ‘as plain sailing as a ship in smooth water.'

336. in proeliui= ‘easy.’ Plaut„ Ter.‚ Sall. :proclivis Cic. Lit. ‘ on
a slope,’ and so easily rolled down, the opposite of ‘uphill work.'

338. ab re, ‘ to my disadvantage.' Cf. v. 296.

339. donicum. In Plautus' time donicum was used before a word
beginning with a vowel, donec (a shortened form of donicum, as nihil of
nihilum) before a word beginning with a consonant. The intermediate
sorm donique we get in Lucretius, e. g. 2. 1116 donique ad extremam
crescendi perfica finem Ι omnia perduxit rerum natura creatrix.

pantur frustra calami, etc.

operam luseris :operam perdideris.

345. transactum reddet=transzgea Periphrases of this kind sor the
future are common in colloquial Latin, especially with dabo, e. g. bene
coctum dabit Mil. 209 ; pulcre ego hanc explicatam rem dabo Pseud. 926 ;
Ιιοε tz'bz' inuentum dabo Ter. Andr. 683. Similarly habeo with the perf.
part. paSS. answers to the perfect, e. g. Mil. 886 regionem consili repertam
habere. The auxiliary verbs in the languages derived from the Latin
are merely stereotyped usages of such a kind.

347. ex sententia ε ‘ to one's mind 3 ' a common phrase in Latin.

348. adeo: ‘moreover,’ ‘further.'

hodie: ‘ at all,' used to strengthen a negative, e. g. Virg. Ecl. 3. 49
