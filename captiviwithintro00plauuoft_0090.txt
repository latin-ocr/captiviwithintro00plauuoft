PLA VTJ CAPTJVJ. 1-1·1-3·

and the Prologue goes on in v. 61 to apologize for depriving the speeta-
tors of the pleasure.

61. iniquomst: ‘would be unfair‚' like longum cst, ‘it would be
tedious‚⁷ morast (v. 906), ‘it would be waste of time.

choragium : the scenery‚ dresses, etc.

62. desubito, an old Latin form. Cf. derepente. The difference be-
tween these and the elassieal forms7 subito, repente, is like that between
‘ of a sudden ' and ⁶ suddenly ‘ in English.

64. aduorsarium. See ν. 705. ‘ Those who are all for a battle-scene
should go to law. If they can get some good strong rival I promise
them a pretty battle—scene that will give thern a distaste sor battles for
the future!

63. ‘And so good-bye to you, kind critics at home, brave fighters in
the field? Duellum is the old form of bellum, from duo. just as bis
points to an older form duis. Horace had a curious liking for this
piece of old Latin, Od. 3. 5. 38 pacem duello miscuit, ib. 3. 14. 18 cadum
Marsi memorem. duclli; ib. 4. 15. 8 vacuum duellis Ι sanum Quirini
clausit: cf. Ep. 1. 2. 73 2. 1. 254; 2. 2. 98.

In Plautus· time it seems to have been a word of two syllables, dvcllum
(pronounce druch), like tz'ngu'B, lz‘ngz'cE, etc.‚ and so this line scans :

d6mi 1 diem Ι que dff‘essl Ι fite Ι res ep l tumr.

Ac‘r 1. SCENE 1.

Enter Ergasilus, a parasite (‘diner-out'), dressed in grey or black
(as the parasiti always were on the stage), looking miserably hungry,
lean (v. 135), and woebegone. He complains of the difficulty in getting
a dinner in these times‚- and laments the absence os his generous young
patron, Philopolemus, who has been taken prisoner by the Eleans.

69. nomen indidit Scorto. The nominative, and not the dative, is
the usual construction in Cicero in nomen cst mihi, etc.‚ e. g. Verr. 4. 5 3
sui nomeu Arethusa est, but in other writers the dative is the favourite
usage. Ovid has a curious sreak of employing the nom. in phrases like
nomen habet, etc.‚ e. g. Met. 6. 400 lllarsya nomen habet; 15. 96 actas,
miserimus aurea nomen ; and he is followed by later prose-writers.

70. The pun on inuocatus, ‘uninvitedss and inuocalus, ‘ invoked,’ if.
‹lifficnlt to reproduce in English.

71. derisores: ‘wags‚’ ·' my brother-parasites‚' as in Hor. Ep. 1. 18.
11 imi Derisor lecti. ‘ The wags call it, Ι know, a poorjoke, but Ι say
it is to the point.'

apsurde: absurdus is lit. ‘ out of tune‘ (cf. Cic. de Or. 3. 11. 41
vox absona et absurda). -
