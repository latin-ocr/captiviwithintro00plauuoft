Roman would utter at the commencement of any undertaking. ‘ Your
new master—and heaven bless the plan to me, my son, and you—-
wishes you to obey your old master's wishes faithfully? The quae res
refers to what comes after, uolt te, etc.‚ and the construction, simple
enough in this passage, throws some light on another construction,
which is not so patent, viz. the use of quod in entreaties; e.¹g. Hor.
Ep. 1. 7. 94 quod te per genium dextramque deosque Penates Ι obsecro
et obtestor, uitae me redde priori, where the antecedent of quod is
uitae me redde priori: ‘put me back in my old life, a thing which
