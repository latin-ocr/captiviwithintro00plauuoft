PREFACE.

Tffls little book does not claim to be a critical edition of
the Captivi. Textual emendation does not come within its
scope. Its only aim is to explain the difficulties in the play.
to supply the necessary stage-directions aster the example
of the Clarendon Press Trz'mcmmus, and so to enable boys
of the Higher Forms os our Schools to read with intelli-
gence and interest a play which, more than any other os
Plautus, may suitably be put into a schoolboy's hands.
Schoolmasters usually find the Plautus-lecture the best
opportunity for teaching the etymology and structure of
Latin words; so Ι have devoted a considerable proportion
of the notes to this subiect. The text used is, in accordance
with the wish of t'ne editor of the Series, that of Fleckeisen
(Teubner), and valuable assistance has been derived for the

notes from the German edition by Julius Brix (4th ed. 1884).
