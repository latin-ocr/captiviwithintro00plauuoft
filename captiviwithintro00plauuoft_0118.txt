“ Forty stripes save one.” ' For the construction see v. 69.

729. neruo: ‘prison' (lit. ‘ thong ’), a common word in Plautus and
Terence.

custodibitur. Cf. v. 785.

730. Interdius„ an adverb=interdz'u. Cf. v. 835.

751. recta: adverb: ‘straight‚' ‘ directly?

754. apsque in old Latin is always accompanied by esset, soret, etc.,
and has the sense of ‘ but f0r‚’ =si sine, e.g. Trin. 832 nam absque fhret
te, sat scio in alto Ι distraxz'ssent disque tulissent satellites tui me miserum
fhede. The word is not used by classical writerS, but reappears in silvei:
- Latin with the sense of ‘ without‚’=sine. It is derived from abs, a form
of ab, and the same particle que as appears in quisque, quandoque, etc„
in the sense of the English ‘ ever‚’ and to which the Homeric τε in ὅς τε,
οἷά τε πολλά, etc. corresponds.

757. Satis sum semel deeeptus =satis est me semel deceptum esse.

quod hoc est scelus ε ‘ what a piece of ill luck is this-‚P Scelus

scelus aut Lapithas tantum aut Calydona merentem ?

763. in orbitatem: ‘in order to be childless‚’ ‘all to be left child-
less in the end.'

764. neminis : neither neminis nor nemine are used by Classical
authors, nullius and nullo taking their place.

766. Exauspicaui and Redauspieandum are Plautine coinages, like
redambulo v. 9003 re-spondeo 898. We should expect deponent forms.
(Cf. v. 935.)
