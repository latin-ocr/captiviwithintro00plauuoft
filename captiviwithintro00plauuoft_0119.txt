ACT IV. SCENE 1.

Ergasilus comes from the harbonr, where he has just met Philocrates
returned from Elis with Philopolemus, and hastens to give the joyful
tidings to Hegio.

769. opiparus= ‘ sumptuous‚’ an ante-classieal word.

770. festiuitatem: ‘feasting.'

771. Pompam: viz. ofmessage-boys bringing the many articles ordered
for the dinner that must commemorate the occasion. ‘ Train ofvictuals.'

774. amoenus dies. Ergasilus’ opinion of the day has changed
since his violent abuse of it in vv. 464—7' Nam hercle ego huic die, si
liceat, oculos ecfodiam lubens, etc.

775. sine sacris hereditatem: a Roman proverb sor ‘ a rose without
a thorn.’ Roman estates were so osten encumbered with religious dues,
(just as a Roman Catholic estate might be now-a-days] that an estate
not so encumbered was a singularly lucky windfall. Cf. Trin. 2. 4. 83
cena lzac annonast sine sacris hereditas.

aptus: from apz'scor.
ecfertissumam: from effirtus, p. p. p. of offertio, or effarcz'o, ‘to
stuff,' ‘ fill out.'

778. certa res est=certum est, freq.

779. Coniciam in collum pallium: i.e. to run the easier. Only
slaves would run in the street. Cf. Poen. 3. 1. 19 liberos homines per
urbem modico magis par est gradu Ι ire: seruoli csse dico, festinantem
currere. Terence Eun. prol. 36 talks of the currens servus as one of
the stock parts of Roman comedy, currentes semes scribere 1 bonas
matronas facere, meretrices malas, Ι parasitum edacem, gloriosum mz'lz'-
tem.

785. scibitur=scz'etur. In the classieal period the true future in -bo
was only used with verbs of the first and second cmrjugation, while the
subjunctive form was used instead of the future in those of the third and
fourth, e.g. capiam, sciam. But this rule was not observed at Plautus’
time, so we have the fut. of the 4th conjugation in -bo in his plays. We
even find a third conjugation future in -bo, viz. reddffbo in Men. 5. 7. 49.
but this is due to the form of the future of the simple verb, dabo.

786. Quom extemplo. Cf. v. 434 supr.

790. age hane rem=lz0c age. Cf. v. 930.

791. interminor: ‘forbids with threats.'

793. ore sistet: ‘will be laid flat on his face ; ’ sisto is here neuter.

798. quisque=quis÷que‚ a particle that answers to our English

37
