NOTES. LINES 1—16.

seruos =servus. Nouns of the second declension in Latin originally

ended in -os, like the second declension in Greek. The 0 became in

course of time u, but was retained when a v (w) preceded, for the Romans
liked the sound of o after v (cf. v. 703).
surpuit=surr72puin Cf. v. 760.

9. Alide. The ‘ Dorie ’ form would of course be the form used by the
Eleans themselves, and so by the Romans. Alfus=El5us in v. 22, etc.,
shows the same shortening of the vowel as we get in platea = πλατεῖα, etc.

10. Domino. Some word is required to eke out the metre of the line
as it stands in the MSS„ and domino, ⁴ master‚' is as good as any. The
word is enclosed in brackets to shew that it is not certainly the original
word.

iam hoe tenetis ,9 optumumst: ‘do you take me? very good.'
The Prologue asks the spectators if they understand the plot as he
has just explained it to them; they nod assent, and he expresses himself
satisfied, when he is interrupted by a noisy fellow in the back of the
theatre.

11. Negat hercle, etc. ‘ There is a man at the back says he does not
(sc. take me). Tell him to come this way. If you cannot get a seat,
sir, you may move about here.’ When the Prologue says est ubi ambules,
he points to the passage between the tiers of seats, where the man might
stand or walk about, if he liked, and watch the play quietly. A pro-
posed reading is abscedite: ‘Tell him to go out then. No room here,
sir, but plenty of room outside. So, be off !'

13. Quando histrionem cogis mendicarier: ‘if you will make the
actor take to the begging line‚' i.e. drop his acting for the moment and
beg of you not to make a disturbance. This is a sar more natural sense
to give to the words than to suppose them to refer to the next line, ego me
tua causa, ete: ‘for really you will bring the actor to beggary‚' i. e.
you will make him lose his voice in trying to be heard above your
disturbance, and then, his occupatiori being gone, he will be reduced to
beggary. Another explanation is that beggars in Rome, who had regular
standing-places (Trin. 42 3), were often asked the way by strangerS. ‘ You
make the actor turn beggar and shew you the way to your seat?

14. ne erres, i. e. ‘to keep yon from misunderstanding the plot.'
Sc rumpere=‘ to crack one's lungs.’

15. Vos qui, ete. ‘ You who pay rates and taxes ' (while ‘ ultimus illic'
has not a ratepayer's income): lit. you whose means entitle you to be
entered on the eensor’s list.

16. Accipite relicuom—a technical phrase of money transactions:
‘let me discharge my debt3' i. e. let me tell you the rest of the plot.
Cf. Cist. 1. 3. 40 nunc quod relicuom restat uolo persoluere, Ι ut expunga-
