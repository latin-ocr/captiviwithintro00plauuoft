PLA VTI CAPTJVJ. 1-1- 26-39-

construction to this : ‘ was captured by the enemy? But it would be in
that case postquam mei sunt regis potiti hostes, ‘aster the enemy were
put in possession of my son.’

Potior, like most Latin deponents, is really a middle or re·
flexive rather than a passive form. Potior alicujus means, ‘ I make
myself master of, put myself in possession of something! Utor,
fruor, ‘ I avail myself;' vescor, pascor, ‘Ifeed myself;' fngor, ‘I
occupy myselfss etc. The abl. aster these words is really the abl. of
mstrument.

94. illistzilli est: illic est (cf. v. 261). Ergasilus would point to his
right as he said this, sor the stage door to the left hand of the speeta-
tors, and the right of the amors, was that which was supposed to lead to
foreign parts and the harbour3 whereas the door to the spectators’ right
was the conventional road to the market-place.

96. lamentariae: a Plautine coinage.

98. Occipio is common in Plautus where Cicero would use z‘nczpz‘o,
‘ to begin.'

quaestum: viz. of a slave-dealer, mango, a hated class at Rome.

101. qui. Cf. v. 28.

. 102. nimis quam :perquam ‘very much,¹ in colloquial Latin. It is
a mixture of the two phrases nimis cupio (a common expression of
colloquial Latin, e.g. Most. 1. 3. 19 nimis uelim lapidem, ‘ I should
like a stone ³) and quam cupio, ‘ how Ι wish ! ' cupio ut seems not to be
used by Plautus, so the reading here is probably wrong.

103. A pun on recrjio, ‘ to recover‚' ‘get or take again ’ (accepia of
course is our English ⁴ receive ’) and se recipe’re, ‘ to betake oneself:

‘ For lte must be recovered, or I shall never recover.’

105. ‘ He is a young gentleman of the good old school. Ine demum,
‘ he and only he,’ ‘ he especially.’

106. gratiis: always trisyllabic in the Comediam, in classical Latin
gratis (cf. dis for diis), is abl. of price, ‘ for mere thanks‚’ ‘ for nothing
but thanks ; ’ ingratiis, a quadrisyllable‚ is abl. of manner, ‘ with thank-
lessness,’ ‘ against one's will: e.g. Mil. 449 PH. mittin me an non
mittis? SC. immo uz' atque inuitam ingratiis, Ι nisi uoluntate abis,
rapiam te domum. But sometimes gratis is abl. of manner and means
‘with thanksulness‚’ ‘pleasantly.'

Tr. : ‘ Never did I smoothe the wrinkles from his brow fornothing‚' sc.
with my jokes.

107. Condjgne has elsewhere in Plautus a bad sense : e.g. Men. 906
condigne autem haec meretrix fecit, ut mos est meretricius.

moratus, from mares, ‘character ;’ maratus, from mb‘ra, ‘ delay!
