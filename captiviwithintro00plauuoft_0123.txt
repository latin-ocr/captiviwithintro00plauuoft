1v. 2. 87—119. NOTES. LJNES 840-899.

867. 'I'e hercle. Ergasilus eheeks himself just as he is going to say
perdant, and obeys the rules of courtesy at the expense of those of
grammar by turning the sentence as he does.

870. Nune tu mihi places: ‘now Ι begin to fancy your dinner3’
refers to vv. 175 sqq.

871. Igitur was originally a word used to introduce the apodosis,
‘ then‚' e. g. in the Twelve Tables, SI IN lvs κὀεΑΤ, Ni 1T, ANTESTATOR‚
IGITVR EM CAPITO, ‘ if a man summon another, and if the other will
not go, he may take byestanders to witness, then he may arrest him?
It had no idea of ‘ cause,' ‘ reason,’ being derived from the demonstrative
pronoun is with the adverbial suffix -tur or -tus‚ as in funditus, etc.,
and meaning ‘in that case‚’ ‘in these circumstances? In classical prose
it usually comes second word in a sentence, though it is not uncommonly
placed first. A good example of its older nse is Mil. 770 quando habebo,
igitur rationem mearum fabricarum dabo.

875. Aleum. Cf. v. 9.

tuum Stalagmum seruom: the usual order; cf. tua Bromia
ancilla Amph. 5. 1. 28 ; meus llbeesz'loclzusfilz'us Bacch. 2. 3. 112.

881. Νὴ τὰν Κόρανε Κόρα, besides being the Greek name of Proser-
pine, was the name os a town in Latium, and the excited brain of
Ergasilus is driven by the association of ideas to swear by all the other
towns in Latium he can think of, Praeneste, Signia, Frusino, Alatrium.

882. Iam diu . . . Venit P ‘ has he been here long? ' A most plausible
reading is tam modo, which we know to have been a Praenestine phrase
for ‘just now' (modo) ; (cf. Trin. 3. 1. 8 tam modo, inquit Praenestinus,
‘ “ e'en n0w‚'’ as the solks say at Praeneste).' This pieee of provincialism,
slipping from Hegio in the excitement of the moment, suggests Praeneste
to the parasite.

883. Vide sis. Cf. v. 643.

884. barbaricas. Cf. v. 49²·

Quia enim: common in Plautus. Cf. Mil. 834 quia enim absorbui.

885. Vae aetati tuae : i. e. vae vitae tuae ‚· a common expression in
every-day Latin.

886. Quippe, i. e. vae aetati tuae quippe, etc.

892. etiam: ‘still.’

895. cellarius: ‘butler.'

896. fusti pectito : a Latin slang expression like our ‘ to give one a
dressing’

897. dapinabo (from daps) is a word of Plautus' coining. ‘ 1'11
dinner yon till doomsday, if it' s true)

898. Vnde id 2²⁶ at whose expense?‘

899. respondeo: (1)‘ 1 promise on my pait,' (2) ‘1 answer.’
