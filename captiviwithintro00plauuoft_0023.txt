IV. How A ROMAN COMEDY WAS PU'I' ΟΝ
THE STAGE.

Dramatical representations did not take place at Rome, as with
us, throughout the whole year. They were only given on certain
occasions, namely, at the public festivals—the Ludi Megalenses
(April 4-9), Ludi Apollinares (July 6), Ludi Romam· (Sept.
4—12), Ludi Plebez'i (Nov. 16-18), and now and then at private
celebrationS, such as the funeral of a distinguished Roman.
The givers of the entertainment were the magistrates who
presided over the games, so that there was nothing at Rome,
in republican times at least, corresponding to our theatrical
managers. Indeed there was no regular theatre until the close
of the Republic, 55 B.C., when Pompey built a stone theatre.
Wooden structures were erected on each occasion of the games,
and pulled down after they had served their purpose. ⁴The plays
were performed by companies of actors (greges or catervae), one
of whom, the dominus gregis, who was generally the chief actor
(actor primarum, sc. partium), bought the piece from the com-
poser, and contracted for the performance of it with the magis-
trate who was to give the entertainment, much in the primitive
fashion that we see in the Midsmnmer-Nz'ghffs Dream.

The wooden platform, which formed the stage, had in the
foreground an altar, at which naughty slaves in Plautus' comedies
often seek protection when in dread of a beating (e. g. Most.
fin.)‚ while the scene at the back represented a Greek house 01·
houses, often with a narrow passage (angiportus) between them.
In this passage actors often conceal themselves, when they
wish to overhear the conversation of those on the stage.
At the left side of the stage (from the spectators) was a door,
