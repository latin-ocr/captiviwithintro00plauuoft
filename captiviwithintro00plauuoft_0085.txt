NOTES.

Personae. Four actors would be required for this piece. The parts
would be allotted as follows:
I. Hegio.
ΙΙ. Philocrates, Aristophontes, Puer (3).
ΠΙ. Tyndarus, Philopolemus.
IV. Ergasilus, Stalagmus.

There would also be ⁴ supers ’ to represent the Lorarii, the slaves in
Act 2. init. etc.

Argumentum. The Arguments prefixed to the plays of Plautus were
not written by Plautus himself, but in a later age. <See Ritschl Prolego- η
mena, chap. xix.)

Prologus. The Prologues to Plautus' plays were, like the Arguments,
not written by Plautus himself, but in the last century of the Republie,
when the comedies of Plautus, Terence, and Caecilius were the favourites
on the Roman stage. We might guess that our prologue was not the
work of Plautus from the fact that there is a mention in v. 12 of seats,
and we know that a theatre with seats for the spectators did not exist at
Rome till long aster Plautus’ time.

The prologue was spoken by the manager of the company (dominus
gregis), or by one of the inferior actors. The person who delivered it
wore a special dress (ornatus prologi), but we do not know exactly what
it was. He sometimes had a hard task to get a hearing. We ean see
from vv. 1 1 sqq. that a disturbance in the back of the theatre was a thing
that could be counted upon with tolerable certainty, so that the lines in
the prologue would always come in appropriately. The digression is
very convenient for the prologue to this play, sor it gives the speaker an
opportunity of repeating the rather intricate plot (vv. 17 sqq), and of
pressing upon the audience the differenee between Philocrates and
Tyndarus.

The Scene, which is unehanged throughout the play, is a street (v. 79 5)
in some Aetolian town, say Calydon, with Hegio's house and others.
On the left hand of the stage (from the spectators) is a door used by
characters going to or coming from the harbour. On the right is another
door through which they pass to or from the market-place. The action
