11-3- 22-61- NOTES. LJNES 350-421.

From adbite're, or its other form arbitere, was derived the noun ανόἴίεν.
Cf. v. 211.

382. pater. Philocrates does not say pater tuus.

385 sqq. Philocrates and Tyndarus have a long and earnest conversa-
tion about Philocrates' departure, in which Tyndarus, as plainly as he
can without arousing the suspicions of Hegio, implores Philocrates not
to forget him when once he has effected his own escape, and Philo-
crates answers his faithful servant that he will take the earliest possible

steps to procure his release from Hegio. Observe the change of the
metre to suit the changed situation.

385. adhuc locorum. This partitive (like ποῦ γῆς ; etc.)‚ loci,
locorum, with adverbs of time and place, is especially frequent in collo—
quial Latin.

390. beneuolentem: acommon word for ‘a friend' in the Comedians.
Indeed benevolens seems to be always a subst. in Plautus, just as bene-
merens is always an adj. The classical form of benevolens is benevolus. Cf.
insciens and inscius.

393. ne praecipias. Cf. v. 331.

tamen: last word in the sentence, as often in the Comedians, e. g.
Mil. 3. 2. 52; Trin. 2. 4. 16.

394. nisi quod. Cf. v. 621.

396. mora merast ε ‘ it is pure waste of time.‘ Illora est is a common
phrase in every-day Latin. Cf. inf. v. 906.

397. uicem z a preposition, really the acc. of an old noun vix, ‘ a
turn‚' ‘shift.’ All prepositions were originally adverbs, and most ad-
verbs were originally cases of nouns, e. g. χάριν, ace. of χάρις ; ergo (e. g.
illius ergo Venimus Virg. A. 6. 670) abl. of *crgum=k'p70v ; supra, infra
abl. fem. of superus, inferus, etc„ etc.

401. tute = tu ÷ te, as iste = is ψ te.

Me . . . inter are probably a later insertion and should be omitted.

405. ‘ Never did I fail you in word or deed in the darkest hour.'

408. Numquam is in colloquial Latin used like our ‘ never ’ in strong
denials, ‘ he will surely never be so stingy.' Cf. v. 657 infr. Very often
lzodz'e is added, cf. v. 348.

gratiis. Cf. v. 106.

418. Hegio is amusingly in the dark about all these repeated allusions
to the faithful slave being rewarded. His suum erum seruos conlau-
dauit (v. 421) must have raised a laugh.

Di nostram fidem: fides, from meaning ‘ promise‚' comes to
mean ‘ promise of protecti0n‚’ and simply ‘ protection.’

420. eorde: ‘from the heart,⁷ ‘heartily.’

421. centensumam: n before s is very often dropped in Latin, e. g.

23
