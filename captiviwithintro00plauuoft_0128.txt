NOTES ΟΝ READINGS.

THE text of the ⁸ Captivi ¹ is at a disadvantage as compared with other
plays of Plautus in not having the help of the ‘ Ambrosian Palimpsest'
(A), a manuscript of the 4th or 5th cent., at Milan, which contains in a
fragmentary state a good deal of the Plautine Comedies. We have ac-
cordingly to sall back on the second most important manuscript, the
‘ Vetus ' (B), of the 11th. cent„ formerly in the Palatine library‚ Heidel-
berg, now in the Vatican, which is supported by the ‘ Vatiean ' MS. (D)
also of the 11th cent., but containing only vv. 1—503 of this play, and a
less important 13th cent. MS. of the British Museum (J).

The principal passages whose reading is in question are these :—

v. 2. The MSS. have illi qui astant, which will not sean. Brix reads
in vinclis qui astant; Fleckeisen vincti quia astant; Spengel z'nvz'tz' qui
astant ,· Schoell iugali qui adstant.

v. 11. Negat hercle ille ultimus, accedito of the MSS. will not scan.
Brix changes ille into illic, treating the final syllable of negat as long.
Fleckeisen inserts vero aster hercle. Schoell reads ultumis accensus,
cedite. Some editors think the sense requires abscedite (but see the note
on this line).

v. 55. See the note.

Act. I. Sc. ii. Schoell has here and elsewhere lolarius, the reading of
the MSS. in this place, and of the best MSS. of Aulus Gellius (X. 3.
19 tanquam in scaenicis sabulis qui dicebantur ‘ lolarz'i’): cf. caelum
and caeruleus ; Pales and Parilia, etc.

v. 1 3 5. Miseramacritudine is the MSS. reading. Fleckeisen proposes
miser aegritudine, in which he is followed by most editors. Schoell
reads I macritudine, comparing Aul. 77 neque quicquam meliust milti, Ι
Ct opinor, quam ex me ut unam faciam litteram Ι Longam, meum
laqueo collum quando obstrz'nxero.

v. 172 sqq. Schoell distributes the lines better:

ERG. Ita di deaeque faxint! Sed numque, etc.

HEG. Nusquam quod, etc.

ERG. Quia mist natalis dies: l Propterea a te uocari ad te ad
cenam uolo.

v. 199. eamque el erili MSS„ duramque erili Brix. Fleckeisen changes
et into etiam. Schoell que et into queit (for quit 3rd sing. of queo).
Nettleship et erz‘lz' imperio: eamque.
