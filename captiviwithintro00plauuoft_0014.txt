10 INTRODUCTION.

is discovered to Hegio by another Elean captive, Aristophontes,
whom Hegio brings to ‘ interview’ the supposed Philocrates, and
Tyndarus is taken away for punishment. From this fate, how-
ever, he is happily rescued by the return of the real Philocrates
from Elis, who brings with him not only Philopolemus, but
Stalagmus, a former slave of Hegio, who had long before kid-

Stalagmus shows that Tyndarus is the boy whom he stole3 and
Hegio’s two sons being thus restored to him in a single day,
the play ends as happily as could be desired.

Π. PLAUTINE PROSODY.

For a long time it was the fashion to deny that the lines of
Plautus could be reduced to any strict laws of metre. In sup-
port of this view the words of Cicero were quoted : Orator 55.

was as absurd, it was urged, to try to bring the lines of Plautus
into the shape of Greek Comic Iambics as it would be to try
to scan every line of the old English comedians,—say this pas-
sage from Middleton, A Tm'cle 2¹0 Calclz tlte Old One, Act i.

Sc. 1.—
‘Arm your wits then

Speedily; there shall want nothing in me,
Either in behaviour, discourse, or fashion,
That shall discredit your intended purpose!

And no doubt such a view was very plausible so long as the
text of Plautus was in the bad state in which it appears in old
editions. But with the discovery of better MSS. it was found
that often, when a faulty line was restored to its true form, it
scanned without any difficulty. Thus, in Merc. 46 obiurgare pater
haec noctes et dies, the reading of old editions is an imperfect
