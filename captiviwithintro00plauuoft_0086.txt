of the play begins 1n the forenoon (v. 127) before the πληθούσης ἀγόρας
(10—12 o‘cloek). Seevv. 191, 478.

1. Hos quos uidetis for hi quos uidetis. This inverse attracti0n‚
as it is called, that is to say, attraction of the demonstrative into the
case of the relative, is not uncommon in Latin. VVell-known instances
are Virg. Aen. 1. 573 urbem quam statuo vestra cst; Ter. Eun. 4. 3. 11
eunuchum quem dedisti nobis, quas turbas dedit. It finds its explanation
in the old Latin usage of repeating the demonstrative in the relative
clause. e. g. Plaut Mil. 140 nam unum conclaue concubmae quod dedet
miles—m eo conclaui ι’ὁ 0 perfodiz'cz parictem: cf. such legal formulas
as quam rem prwzetm ex lzac lc σε egcrzt si eam rem, etc. The full
phrase would be quam urbem slaluo vestra est llaec urbs: quem eu-
nuchum dedisti nobis quas turbas lzz'c eunuchus dedit,

The attraction of the relative into the case of the demonstrative is
frequent in Greek, being in fact the regular usage of Attie writers, e.g.
χρῶμαι οἷς ἔχω βιβλίοις, but rare in Latin, e. g. Hor. Sat. 1. 6. 14 notante
Judzce quo nosti populo.

2. Vineti quia astant. The Prologue is making fun of poor Philo-
crates and Tyndarus who are standing in some painful‚ constrained
attitude at the side of the stage; tied to a post, let us suppose, with their
hands bound behind their backs, and heavily chained (v. 113). An
English eomedian might say,

This pair of captives you see standing here,-
Bound as they are, are almost bound to stand3
Ι think you 'll all admit the force of that.

The plot of the play, turning as it does on the interchange of
parts between Philocrates and Tyndarus, would be hard for an ordinary
Roman audience to follow, and so the two are brought on the stage at
the first, although they do not say anything, that the audience may
have time to examine them and get familiar with their appearance. But
they are not seen after the Prologue until Act 2. Sc. Ι.

5. set=sed.

suo sibi. In colloquial Latin suus sibi, ‘his own‚’ was used as a
stronger expression than the simple suus, ‘ his;’ the sibi being in no
particular grammatical construction. A prose-writer would use proprius:
So v. 46 sua sibi fallacia3 50 suo sibi seruit palm} 81 suo silai suco
uiuent, ete.

8. Alium for alterum. By a similar negligence we often say in
English ‘the best of two things' instead of ‘the better of two things?
In post· -elassical Latin alzus often takes the place of alter in such phrases
as Tac Hist. 4. s *3 ne ques altus Arzovistus regnum Gallim um poteretur
—‘ a second Ariovistus)
