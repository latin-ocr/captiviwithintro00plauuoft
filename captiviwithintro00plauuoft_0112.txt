PLA VTI CAPTIVI. ΙΙΙ. 4. 31—51.

In Plautus' own time Greek names were learnt, not as in earlier times
from intercourse with Greek merchants, etc., but from Greek books, and
so the Latin forms he uses in his plays correspond very nearly with the
Greek, the most patent differences being this insertion of a vowel to
facilitate the pronunciation of a guttural combined with λ, μ, ν (when
such a combination followed a short vowel), and the transliteration of
θ, φ, χ by t, p, c, of υ by u, and of( by ss (forthe letters tlz‚plz‚ clz, y, z
did not come into use till Cicero's time to express θ, φ, χ, υ, ζ.) Α
word like κύκνος would be in Plautus’ time Latinised in the form cucinus,
e-g. Men. 854 barbatum tremulum Tithonum, qui cluet C ucz'no patre.
In Cicero’s time it would be cygnus, the cn of the Greek being found
too hard for a Roman mouth to pronounce and so changed into gn.
Alemaeus atque Orestes et Lycurgus: a famous trio of
madmen, cf. Anacr. 31
