PLA νγ] CAPTJVJ. 1· 3-63-90-

formosus is in old Latin fhrmonsus, centesimus is centensumus, etc.
Mostellaria, the name of Plautus‘ comedy, should be lisonstellarz'a, for it

comes from monstrum, and means literally ‘ the play about the spectre ; ’ .

or, as the title would probably be in English, ‘The Haunted House,'
(alluding to the story told by Tranio to Theopropides that his house
was haunted). For quotiens we often get the spelling quoties, and on
inscriptions we have COSOL, CESOR, etc. We can easily account for this
dropping of n before s by the help of a remark of Cic. (Or 48. 159),
that a vowel before ns was pronounced long. This dwelling on the
sound of the vowel obscured the sound of the nasal.

423. occasio .. . cumulare=occasio cumulandi3 afrequent construc-
tion in colloquial Latin. Cf. Pers. 725, Cure. 59, Poen. 5. 4. 42.

425. opera: ‘in deed.’ Opera experiri is a common expression, e. g.
Trin. 826.

4²9· operis: the plural ofabstract nouns is osten found in Plautus, e. g.
opulentiae Trin. 2. 4. 89 ; industriae Most. 2. 1. 1 ; perfidiae infr. 522.

433. pigneri=ng1n0r22 Neuter nouns in -us wavered between the
older declension in -0ris, and the later form in ·eris (cf. verto and verto).
We have pzjgnus -oris, tempus -orz's, etc.‚ but foedus -eris‚ scelus -eris, ete.
, But we occasionally find pignus -eris, as here, and the locative case of
tempus survives in the adverb temperi (v. 18 3 supr.) ; cf. tempestas, in-
tempestus, etc.

434. quom extemp10=÷ne2 τάχιστα, is frequent in Plautus (cf. v.
786 inin), though it is not used by Terence.

439. fidele = fideliter, like facile = faciliter, a very rare word.

441. hunc: i. e. Hegio, ‘ and do not lose this one you have found.'

444. Hoc age. Cf. v. 930 infr.

446. Satin habes : ‘are you content ? ⁹ the regular phrase.

447. ornatus τ ‘ provided, i. e. accompanied by PhilopolemuS. Orno
really means ‘to equip‚’ ‘ to provide' in Latin, not ‘to adom.'

448. Numquid aliut ἱ) Cf. v. 191.

449. uiaticum : ‘ money for the road.'

trapezita : a Greek word. The native Latin word for a banker

is argentan'us. Roman bankers did very much the same business as
English bankers. A Roman would deposit his money with an mgen-
tarius, and when he wanted money for any purpose would either go in
person or send a cheque (perscriptio) for the amount required.

450. Eadem opera. Cf. v. 293.

syngraphum. It must be remembered that Aetolia and Elis were

at war. We have another allusion to the Greek use of passports in
Aristophanes Av. 1213
