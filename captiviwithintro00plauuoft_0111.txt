is skulking: then his attempts to conceal it from Aristophontes; then
the sudden gleam of hope that would lighten it when the idea occurs to
him to persuade Hegio that Aristophontes is a lunatic. Masks did not
come into use on the Roman stage till after the time οἱ Terence, and
certainly the fun osa great many of Plautus' scenes would be lost if the
facial expression of the actor were not seen.

548. istie. See v. 761. Cf. illic 550.

auris inmittas tuas : the ace. govemed by the in— of inmittas, as
Lucr. 1. 117 an pecudes alias diuinitus insinuet se.

550. qui sputatur morbus ε lit. ‘the malady which is spat 0n‚' i.e.
‘the malady cured by spitting on the patient’ (cf. v. 5 54), ‘that ail-
ment with the spitting cure.' The malady referred to was probably
melancholia; cf. Galen 19. p. 706. Sputo is the frequentative of spuo.
But perhaps the right reading is qui insputatur morbus.

551. Vltro istum a me: sc. arcete. prohibeto. ‘ Keep him off l keep him
off ἔ ’ Ultro has here its literal sense, as in ultro citroque, ‘ to the further
side,' just as citr0=‘ to this side: intro= ‘to the inside.’ From meaning
‘to the further side,' it came to mean ‘ furthermoress ‘ besides,' e. g. Virg.
A. 2. 145 lzis lacrimis uitam damus et miserescimus ultro ; and gradually
acquired the sense of ‘ besides what one required to do,' ‘ of one's own
accord.'

Ain=aisne. See v. 317.

553. ut qui. The adverb qui, ‘h0w,' came to be used in colloquial
Latin as a mere particle with certain conjunctions and adverbs (cf. its
use with ‘as' in vulgar English ‘as how'), e.g. hercle qui, edepol qui,
utqui, nequi (v. 738 insu), atqui. Of these compounds only the last
established itself in the classical language.

556. etiam: ‘ still!

557. intuitur: from intuor, a byform of intueor Most. 3. 2. 150.
So cantui ib. 3. 2. 1523 obtuffre ib. 1, 1. 66; 3. 2-151.

concedi optumumst z ‘ you had better retire.’

560. siet. See v. 193.

561. Hau uidi magis: ‘a likely story ξ’ an ironical expression of
disbelief, common in colloquial Latin. Cf. Amph. 2. 2. 47, the full
phrase would be lcau uidi qui magis sodalis meus sit.

562. Alemaeus. It is more probable that the form Plautus would use
is A lcumaeus or A lcumb‘us 3 for the Romans ofhis time seem to have been
unable to pronounce such combinations of consonants in Greek words
without inserting a vowel. Ἀσκλὴπιος became Aesculapius, τέχναι teclt-
inae, μνᾶ mina, δραχμή drachuma. In still earlier times the attempts to
Latinise Greek names were often ludicrously wide of the mark, Polluces
for Πολυδεύκης, Catamitus for Γανυμήδης, Proserpina for Περσεφόνη, etc.
