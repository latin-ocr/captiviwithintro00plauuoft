PLA VTI CAPTIVI. 11·2·43-31·

293. eadem: ‘at the same time.' Both eadem opera and eadem alone
are used.
exquisiuero. Cf. v. 194.
296. e re = ‘to one’s advantage ς ’ a re=‘to one's disadvantage.'
297. ‘ Ι may tell you Ι have heard it all already from your slave.’
302. cum istoc=cum istius opibus. Grammarians give the name of
compendiary comparison to this construction.
303. Memini quom Ξμέμνημαι ὅτε.
304. artat: ‘ narrows,' from artus. ‘Look you! chance moulds and
pinches us as it chooses.’
305. fueram :fui or eram. Cf. v. 17.
307. proinde ut. Plautus does not use proinde ac.
familiae. The word familia seems here to have its original
meaning ‘the slaves (famuli) of a household.’
309. nisi forte ipse non uis: ‘ if you do not mind.'
nolueram. Cf. v. 17.
310. The audience would see the suitableness of the comparison better
than Tyndarus himself.
314. habueris and eurauerit have very much the same meanings. Cf.

, Luer. 2. 31 iucunde corpora curant and 5. 1394 iucunde corpora habebant.

315. profuerit. Cf. v. 194.

317. faterin :saterisne. Final s was pronouneed very faintly in
Latin, like final s in French, and tended to be dropped altogether. In
early Latin poetry it was elided (i. e. not pronounced) before a word
beginning with a consonant, and even in prose such forms as ain, viden
got a secure footing. VVords like ῑρςεειρςιις, necesse=necessus, ille=
ellus, legere and lege-mk, legebam and legebam's, ete. show the same loss os
final s. A final consonant faintly pronounced like s was very easily
dropped in a language like Latin which never accented final syllables, and
not only final consonam, but final vowels, e. g. final ἔ in faterin =faterisne‚
dic=dice‚ hic=lzice, nec=neque, etc. The English language resembles
the Latin in throwing the accent as far back as possible, while Freneh, like
Greek, accents final syllables ; and so we have in modern English dropped
the final e that we see in Chaueer's ‘ Aprille,’ ete.

324. uirtute: ‘kindness.'

32 7. Est . .. ubi=Zcrrw ὅπου, ‘ in some cases!

329. hoc may be acc. after animum aduerte, but it is more probably
:hun Cf. v. 480.

pariter: se. mecum.

331. duis. See v. 947. The pres. subj. with ne in prohibitions is
only used in classieal Latin when the prohibition is a general one, ‘ do
not steaL’ ‘thou shalt not stea1‚’ ‘steal not ;’ but not, as here, where
